## Backend 
### Configuration

- Configuration **Express** , a microframework that deals with routes, requests and responses;
- Configuration **nodemon** to monitor code changes and restart the server automatically when changes occur;

### Instructions for running the backend

- After cloning the repository, enter the backend folder and run the npm install command. It is a package manager that will download the project's dependencies.
- After downloading all the dependencies, still inside the backend folder. This command is a shortcut to npm knex migrate: latest, which will perform the migrations responsible for creating the tables in the database.
- With the tables created, run npm start to boot the server.

## Frontend

### Configuration
  - Configuration **BrowserRouter** and **Route** (lib *react-router-dom*) to handle navigation and each route individually;
  - Configuration of **axios** to make the request to the database;
